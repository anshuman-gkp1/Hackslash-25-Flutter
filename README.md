# Hackslash-25-Flutter
In this project I have tried to make UI of travel of as given.
I have imported all required fonts and images needed in this project.
I have used flutter widgets to complete the given project like column, 
row, container, spacer, sizedbox, cliprreact, cards,etc.
First of all I have I made a column and added container wherever needed for writing text.
Then for adding images and text I made a row used Cards widget and container widget.
I faced difficulty while shifting star icon and rating at rightmost corner then 
I learnt about spacer widget and align widget alongwith align method.
After that I made it scrollable and added other required inputs.
I added tour packages text in next container and elevated it to give it similar effect.
after that i added last two cards in container in row for banaras and agra.
